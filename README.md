# PyBer_Analysis
## Project Overview
Analysis project for a ride-sharing company called PyBer. The results look at data from January to April 2019 and shows the summary by city type and also other relevant data, such as totals of rides, drivers and fares. 
## Resouces 
1. Data Sources: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv
2. Software: Python 3.8.5, Jupyter Notebook 6.1.4
## Results
The ride share data summary shows the result based the city type. From summary below it shows that the Urban cities had the most rides, drivers and largest amount of fares. However the average fare ride and fare per driver was the lowest of all the city types. This could be due to the large amount of drivers available in the Urban cities, making it more competitive to among urban drivers to pick up rides and therefore the average fare per driver is a lot less compared to the two other city types. 
Similarly, Rural cities had the less amount of total rides, total drivers and total fares with the average fare per ride and per driver being the highest compared to the two other city types. Again this could be due to the Rural cities having a lot less available drivers, make it less competitive for drivers to pick up rides.

In this line graph below it shows the total fares by city type from January to April 2019. Again the trend shows that the Urban cities have the highest total fares compared to the Rural cities. Overall the Suburban cities come inbetween in the middle compared to these two city types.

## Summary 
1. Due to the large differences in the total number of drivers available in the Rural cities compared to the Urban cities, one recommendation may be to place a cap on the number of drivers available in the Urban cities. This should control the competition and availability of drivers in the Urban cities which could then increase the average fares. 
2. Conversely another recommendation could be to increase the number of drivers in Rural cities to increase availability, creating more competition amongst drivers and therefore decreasing average fares for Rural customers. This would dependent on the marketing strategy of the company, i.e. if PyBer wants to make their rides more affordable in Rural cities (towards a similar amount of average fares in the Urban cities). 
3. Another recommendation could be to place "minimum fare cap" in all cities, to make rides afforable and fair in each city which might draw in more customers as they know it is the same starting fare wherever they are in the cities if they use PyBer.
